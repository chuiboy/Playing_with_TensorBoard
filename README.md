# Playing_with_TensorBoard
TensorBoard is a great tool for visualizing models and their performances. In this repository I train a ConvNet on the Fashion MNIST dataset and get TensorBoard working with it.  I try to get  TensorBoard working for models created with both Keras and TensorFlow. Note that you need to download the dataset from Kaggle and read it from wherever you saved it to.
